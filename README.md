# Carbon-Prediction

Welcome to my code for the UmojaHack Africa 2023: Carbon Dioxide Prediction Challenge!

The aim of the challenge is to create machine learning and deep learning models to predict carbon emissions using open-source CO2 emissions data obtained from satellite observations. This data includes predictors from Sentinel-5P, an ESA satellite dedicated to monitoring air pollution, and ground truth CO2 emissions collected from GRACED and EDGAR. The challenge dataset covers around 800 locations in 20 areas in South Africa, including farm lands, cities, and power plants.

The training set contains 361 locations, while the test set contains 137 locations from a different province than the training set, ensuring that the model is generalizable to different regions.
